# advent-calendar-angular-js

This is a really simple AngularJS project for the best advent calendar ever.

## How-to use

- Serve the file with a HTTP server like Apache.

- Click on the red-bordered window to open it and discover a really cute cat.

- Nobody can wait 25 days to open his advent calendar so there are no time-based constraints, however you have to respect the opening order. If you are really behaved, you can close your browser anytime : your progress is locally saved ;)

- The snowstorm is only supported in IE8+.

# Happy Christmas !
